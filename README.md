# Risk Register and Risk Matrix

## Risk Register

A **Risk Register** is a process used to document and manage potential risks that may impact a project, organization, or operation. It helps identify, assess, and control risks to minimize negative outcomes. 

### Steps in a Risk Register Exercise:
1. **Risk Identification**: Identify potential risks.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks based on likelihood and impact.
3. **Risk Analysis**: Analyze the cause and consequences.
4. **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop actions to reduce risks.
5. **Risk Monitoring and Review**: Regularly monitor and review risks.

### Components of a Risk Register:
- **Risk ID**: Unique identifier.
- **Risk Description**: Brief description.
- **Likelihood**: Probability of occurrence.
- **Impact**: Severity if it happens.
- **Risk Rating**: Priority score based on likelihood and impact.
- **Mitigation Actions**: Steps to mitigate the risk.
- **Risk Owner**: Responsible person.
- **Status**: Current status (active, mitigated, etc.).

## Risk Matrix

A **Risk Matrix** helps visualize risks based on their likelihood and impact, allowing for easier prioritization.

### Key Components:
1. **Likelihood**: Probability of the risk happening.
   - **Rare**: Unlikely.
   - **Unlikely**: Low chance.
   - **Possible**: Medium chance.
   - **Likely**: High chance.
   - **Almost Certain**: Very likely.
   
2. **Impact**: Consequences if the risk happens.
   - **Insignificant**: Minimal impact.
   - **Minor**: Manageable.
   - **Moderate**: Serious but manageable.
   - **Major**: Significant impact.
   - **Catastrophic**: Severe impact.

### Risk Matrix Example:

| Impact \ Likelihood | Rare  | Unlikely | Possible | Likely  | Almost Certain |
|---------------------|-------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Catastrophic**     | Red   | Red      | Red      | Red     | Red            |
| **Major**            | Red   | Red      | Red      | Orange  | Orange         |
| **Moderate**         | Yellow| Yellow   | Orange   | Orange  | Yellow         |
| **Minor**            | Yellow| Green    | Yellow   | Yellow  | Green          |
| **Insignificant**    | Green | Green    | Green    | Green   | Green          |

### Risk Levels:
- **Red**: High priority – immediate action needed.
- **Orange**: Medium priority – monitor closely.
- **Yellow**: Low priority – monitor.
- **Green**: Very low risk – no immediate action needed.
